        "\n",
        "These days we are exposed to an abundance of unlabeled data either from the Internet or from some other source such as academia or business worlds. Due to the fact that unlabeled data is relatively easy to acquire and is expensive to label, companies usually employ an expert or several employees whose purpose is to label data [1]. Consider the following situation, a data-driven medical company has a lot of MRI scans and they need to employ an expert that will help them interpret these scans. The company has limited resources and they cant interpret or label all of their data; this is the point where they decide to use active-learning (AL). The promise of AL is that by iteratively increasing the size of our carefully selected labeled data, it is possible to achieve similar (or greater [2]) performance to using a fully supervised data-set with a fraction of the cost or time that it takes to label all the data. AL is considered to be a semi-supervised method, between unsupervised and fully supervised in terms of the amount of labeled data, i.e., for unsupervised data we use 0% labeled samples and for fully supervised we use 100% labeled samples. Therefore, the decision of how much data to use or alternatively how much performance is required from the model relies on a resource management decision, in other words it can be a business decision. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are three scenarios for AL: \n",
        "1. Membership Query Synthesis, i.e., a generated sample is sent to an oracle for labeling.\n",
        "2. Stream-Based Selective Sampling, i.e, each sample is considered separately for labeling or rejection.\n",
        "3. Pool-Based sampling, i.e., sampled are chosen from a pool of unlabeled data for the purpose of labeling [3]. \n",
        "In this tutorial we use the third scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following pseudo algorithm represents the learning process, as written in the code, for pool-based sampling:\n",
        "1. Divide the data to a 'pool' and a test-set\n",
        "2. Select 'k' samples from the pool for the initial train-set and label them, the remaining data will be the validation-set\n",
        "3. Normalize all the sets\n",
        "4. Train the Model using the train-set, with balanced weights.\n",
        "5. Use the trained model with the validation-set, get probabilities per sample.\n",
        "6. Use the trained model with the test-set, get performance measures.\n",
        "7. Select 'k' most-informative samples based on per-sample-probabilities, i.e., those that the model was most uncertain about regarding their labelling.\n",
        "8. Move these 'k' samples from the validation set to the train-set and query their labels.\n",
        "9. Inverse normalization for all the data-sets\n",
        "10. Stop according to the stop criterion, otherwise go to 3. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few things to note before going forward: \n",
        "1. The fully-supervised performance of a chosen algorithm is usually the upper bound, therefore it is advisable to try several algorithms.\n",
        "2. Normalization for all sets must be inversed and normalized again after we remove samples from the validation set, because our sample distribution changed in both the new validation and new train-sets.\n",
        "2. The sample selection function relies on test-sample probabilities derived from the trained model, therefore we can only use algorithms that provide access to sample probabilities.\n",
        "3. 'k' is a hyper parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "Our most important tool in AL method is the sample selection function, this is the only point where we influence the learning process and it crucial to use the right method. This area is a hot research topic and there are many studies that propose competing selection functions. \n",
        "In this tutorial I propose four known selection functions:\n",
        "1. Random selection - we select 'k' random samples from the validation set.\n",
        "2. Entropy selection - we select 'k' samples with the highest entropy, i.e., with high uncertainty.\n",
        "3. Margin selection - we select 'k' samples with the lowest difference between the two highest class probabilities, i.e., a higher figure will be given for samples whose model was very certain about a single class and lower to samples whose class probabilities are very similar. \n",
        "\n",
        "The code provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/112qNUli8PHh66Tnc9sHrv7fGLDdD3Ri4/view?usp=sharing) utilizes a modular architecture in terms of selecting various learning algorithms and selection functions and can be used as a base for other model-function comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "We compare several learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LOG). Each algorithm was executed with all of the selection functions using all 'k' = [10,25,50,125,250], accumulating a total of 80 experiments. Due to the random nature of some of the algorithms and the selection functions, it is advisable to run repeated experiments in the code in order to calculate a statistical significant result. However, running times are long and I have chosen to run the experiment only once for each combination of (model,function,k).\n",
        "\n",
        "The following is an explanation of the code and its class architecture.\n"
